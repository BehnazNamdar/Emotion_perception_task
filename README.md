# Emotion_perception_task
This is a code of a Emotion perception cognitive task and psychometric curves.


It is desirable to implement the cognitive task related to the emotional perception of images, with below details:

1- There is 500 milliseconds of fixation

2- Show the mask image of two happy or sad images with the noise level of 0, 30, 60, 100 for 200 milliseconds.

3- Display each image for 50, 100, 150, 200 milliseconds.

4- Show the mask again for 200 milliseconds

5- After  1 second interval , subject must recognize happiness or sadness. One should make his choice with S and H keys.

6- You have a total of 2 images (joy and sadness) * four noise levels * four display times. There are 32 ways to get a total of 320 trials from 4 people by repeating 10 times. And then draw the psychometric curve for different display times for each emotion. Then draw the psychometric function for each display time and each emotion. fit logit function to psychometric function.
